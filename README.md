# Angular Express Seed With HTML

This is an Angular / Express seed project is which adapted from Brian Ford's Angular Express Seed (<https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed>). Credit also goes to Mr. Ford for the intro and how to use sections of this readme.

Instead of using the Jade templating engine; however, this seed uses HTML for markup.

## Intro

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.

## How to use angular-express-seed

Clone the angular-express-seed repository, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js

### Receiving updates from upstream

Just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
